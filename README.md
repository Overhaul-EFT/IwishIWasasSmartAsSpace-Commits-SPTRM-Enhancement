Hey fontaine it's yepitsme from the hub, the guy that wanted to make the incapacitated state and add some new bleed levels. I'm about to make a pull request (though I doubt you'll go for it, though just know I would not package any files from you and your client and server mods would be a hard requirement and then I would simply include (If I ever release anything) the back up files for each time you post a new iteration of SPT:RM in a separate archive within the one that would get downloaded called "Fontaines_backups.rar" with a readme stating ensure you are running the latest SPT:RM by Fontaine at [LINK] and use a new save until testing is finished. You can remove the SPTRMchanges.dll at any time and replace the server files with the files in backup.rar (or something)
