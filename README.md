Hey fontaine it's yepitsme from the hub, the guy that wanted to make the incapacitated state and add some new bleed levels. I'm about to make a pull request (though I doubt you'll go for it, though just know I would not package any files from you and your client and server mods would be a hard requirement and then I would simply include (If I ever release anything) the back up files for each time you post a new iteration of SPT:RM in a separate archive within the one that would get downloaded called "Fontaines_backups.rar" with a readme stating ensure you are running the latest SPT:RM by Fontaine at [LINK] and use a new save until testing is finished. You can remove the SPTRMchanges.dll at any time and replace the server files with the files in backup.rar (or something)

If you don't wanna approve te request that's okay I don't plan to just 'edit' files but fully replace them with my own code and thus far all I am planning to do is add a more 'day-z'ish' style of gunplay where regardless if it's a ricochet or a 22 and it hits flesh you'll need to patch the bleed along with adding a new aiming system to replace the "point aim" which I call "intuitive aim". (using a combo of deadzone and ray cast tracing the nearest enemy within 20 feed will simply tilt the axis of the Z position/muzzle in the direction of the enemy with a very high likliehood of successfully hitting them whilst they are 10-15 feet away tops and after that have it start slowly and grow exponenitially higher in dispersion unless a cooldown of 3000ms is given between each shot and aiming would simply raise the sights near the eye ball but the disengage active(intuition aim) would then make it go back to your default setting.

Would be neat if I could get the AI to enter a level of -1 health but have it return botIsAlive (bool = false) return as true upon reaching 0.1 or 1.0 health and have it skip it's default via the "SUPERBASICTESTLOGIC.CS".
